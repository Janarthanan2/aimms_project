# AIMMS - AI Integrated Money Management System

The integration of advanced AI models within a financial management system, aimed at automating expense tracking, categorizing transactions, and predicting financial goals to improve user financial health.

## About
AIMMS (AI Integrated Money Management System) is a project designed to integrate machine learning and OCR technologies to streamline personal finance management. Traditional methods involve manual data entry and lack predictive insights. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by creating an automated interface that scans receipts, categorizes spending, and predicts future financial milestones.

## Features
- **Advanced OCR Integration**: Utilizes specialized deep learning models (Donut) for accurate receipt text extraction.
- **Automated Categorization**: Implements DistilBERT infrastructure for higher accuracy in transaction classification.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasting financial goals and spending trends using XGBoost and Logistic Regression.
- **High Scalability**: Built on a robust Microservices architecture.
- **Secure & Efficient**: Optimized for low latency and high data security.
- **API Response Model**: Standardized JSON data formats for seamless communication between services.

## Requirements
- **Operating System**: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10/11 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
- **Backend**: Java 17+ and Spring Boot for the core application logic.
- **Frontend**: Node.js and React/Vite for a responsive user interface.
- **Deep Learning Env**: Python 3.8+ is necessary for the AI microservices.
- **DL Frameworks**: PyTorch and Transformers for model inference; Scikit-learn for regression models.
- **Database**: MySQL for structured data storage.
- **Version Control**: Implementation of Git for collaborative development.
- **IDE**: Use of VSCode or IntelliJ IDEA.
